The app is designed to order coffee with different toppings.
The order is sent by E-Mail, SMS or another text based app to the person you want.

After you entered your name you can select 1-100 cups with different topings for each coffee individual. Therefore you can choose chocolate or whipped cream topping (or both of course). And also you can add your personal wishes in the text box.
